Sample bedbug policy
====================

.. Infestation in the library

. Staff will regularly inspect the library premises (including furniture, bookshelves, library materials, etc.) for signs that bed bugs are or have been present.

. Any signs of suspected infestation detected by staff or reported by members of the public will be promptly reported to the library administration for further inspection and response.

. If signs of a bedbug infestation are found in the library, the library director will follow the library's current procedures for confirming that an infestation exists and for removing the infestation.

. All suspected infestations in the library will be documented in writing.

.. Infested materials in returned materials

. Staff will routinely inspect all incoming materials, including those returned at the service desks, book-drops, and via courier delivery, for signs that bed bugs are present or have been present.

. All incoming materials suspected of bed bug infestation by library staff will be isolated following the library's current procedures.

. Incoming materials that are significantly infested or damaged will be destroyed.

. Incoming materials with minor or suspected signs of bed bug infestation will be treated following the library's current procedures.

. Incoming materials owned by other libraries with any signs of bed bug infestation will be isolated and the library director will contact the director of the owning library as soon as possible following procedure (X).

. Staff will work to determine if a bed bug infestation occurred while the materials were in the library or if the infestation occurred while the materials were on loan to a patron.

. All suspected infestations of incoming materials will be documented in writing.

.. dealing with the source of contaminated materials (patrons or other libraries)

. If infested materials are returned by a member of the community, the library will follow a course of informing, warning, and suspension with the patron.

  . The first time a patron returns bedbug infested materials, the library director will contact the patron to inform them of the infestation.
  . The second time a patron returns bedbug infested materials, the library director will contact the patron to warn the patron that their residence may be the source of the infestation.
  . The third time a patron returns bedbug infested materials, the library director will suspend the patron's borrowing privileges and then contact the patron in writing to inform them of the suspension.
  . The library director will document all contact with the patron.

. Patrons who have had their borrowing privileges suspended because of a bed bug infestation may have their suspension lifted by demonstrating that they have had their residence treated for bed bugs.

. Patrons who have had their borrowing privileges suspended because of a bed bug infestation may appeal their suspension in writing to the library's board of trustees.
  . Upon receiving an appeal of suspension, the clerk of the board of trustees will immediately inform the patron that the appeal has been received and of the date, time, and location of the next meeting of the board of trustees.
  . At the next meeting of the board of trustees, the library trustees will consider the appeal and determine whether or not to lift the suspension.
  . The chair of the board of trustees will inform the patron of the outcome of the appeal in writing within 2 weeks of the determination.

. If infested materials arrive through ILL (through the KLE courier, the USPS, or any other means of transportation), the library director will immediately inform the library that shipped the materials of the infestation.

. If infested materials were shipped via the KLE courier, the library director will also inform the KLE courier coordinator.  {KLE is working on developing its own bed bug procedures}

.. and training staff on implementing the bedbug policies

. The library director will be responsible for implementing procedures to enforce these policies.

. The library director will be responsible for ensuring that all staff receive any regular training necessary to implement the procedures necessary for enforcing these policies.
