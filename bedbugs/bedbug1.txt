. We recommend that every library develop a "Bedbug Policy" as well as a set of written procedures for how to handle a bedbug problem.

The policy should address identifying signs of bedbug infestation; handling of infestation in the library; handling infested materials; dealing with the source of contaminated materials (patrons or other libraries).

. We recommend that every library train their staff on identifying signs of bedbug infestation in their library; in items that are returned; and in items they receive from the courier.

. NEKLS is buying a ZapBug Heater that can be loaned to member libraries to treat materials that have been infested and are in good enough condition to stay in circulation.

. Materials that are visibly damaged should be discarded.

. We recommend that libraries only suspend a patron's borrowing privileges in cases where it is clear that the bedbug infestation originated at the patron's address.  Any policy that can lead to a patron's borrowing privileges being suspended should clearly state how the patron can have the suspension lifted and should include a process for appeal.

. We recommend that policies discourage patrons from treating infested materials themselves.
