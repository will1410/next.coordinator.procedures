Hello everyone.  My name is George Williams and I'm the Next Search Catalog coordinator for Northeast Kansas Library System in Lawrence, Kansas.  We currently have 51 libraries all working out of a shared Koha - we have about 400,000 bibliographic records, 1,000,000 items and about 100,000 patrons.   Our headquarters is in Lawrence but our libraries using the shared catalog are scattered around the area and they vary in size from small (about 4,000 items) to medium sized (about 80,000 items).  We've been operating this shared catalog on Koha since 2008 - about 11 years.  But I've only been here for about 3 years now.

In addition to working for NEKLS, I'm also currently the President of koha-US and the reason I was asked today to talk today was to talk a bit about koha-US and who we are and what we're doing and how we got to where we are and what we're hoping to do in the future.

In 2013 the international KohaCon was in Reno, Nevada.  Naturally a lot of people from the US attended and when it was over many of the people that had met there from the US talked about getting together again somewhere in the US because most of them knew that they would not have the funding to go to KohaCon2014 in Argentina.

So, in August of 2014 about 30 of us US Koha users met in Wenatchee, WA.  This conference was a loosely organized affair - it was "Unconference" style.  There was no schedule, no agenda, no speakers, just a big room with a bunch of tables and when someone wanted to get up and show people what they were working on, they just did.

Some of the things that came out of that conference were the "Show local copy" jQuery (https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/JQuery_Library#Show_Local_Copy_Status_in_Staff_Search_Results.2C_Hide_all_others_.28Variation.29) and the "Holds queue work-around" (https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Holds#Holds_Queue_Work-Around_for_Bug_18001) which were worked on by people who began collaborating through meeting at that conference.

The aftermath of this first conference was that we decided 1) we would try to have another US conference in 2015 and 2) we would try to form ourselves as a US non-profit corporation - in the US that's a 501(3)(c) non-profit which allows us to incorporate like a business but not pay any taxes - but in a good not pay any taxes way - not like Amazon which is a for-profit corporation that doesn't pay any taxes in the US.

Anyway, in 2015 we had a conference in Eerie, PA, which had about 40 attendees and then in 2016 we had a conference in Monterrey, CA, with about 50 attendees, and in 2017 we had a conference in Coeur d'Alene, ID, with about 75 attendees.  So, each time we meet the conference gets a little bit bigger.

And the annual conferences have been great.  It's great to get together with everyone and talk and share ideas and all that and we work together on thing and learn from each other and all that.  The bulk of our meetings, though, have been online.  We use Zoom to have monthly meetings.  We meet on the second Wednesday of every month usually at 15:30 UTC in the summer or 16:30 UTC in the winter.  And we keep a schedule on our website at http://koha-us.org/ - you can actually get to the calendar through the widget on the bottom of the page - and anyone is welcome to attend.  We also archive those meetings on Youtube.  So if you wanted to sit down and watch a koha-US meeting from November of 2015, you can do that here:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbnGngRlVVUlw_I5AjIxaw

The other things we try to do are mentoring.  Whenever we have new people that attend our meetings, if they say they want someone to help mentor them and help them learn more about Koha, we maintain a list of people that are willing to be mentors so we can try to connect people who are new to Koha.  We also, well, since we're a US non-profit, we can accept donations, so we try to raise money to help pay for the things we need.  We get the Google For Non-Profits software for free since we are a US Non-profit but we do need money to pay for things like domain registration, some software that we're using, and we raise money to help pay for the conference, of course, but we also try to raise money to help pay for developments.  Currently we have about $1900 in our development fund.

Our big thing that we want to move forward with this year is that we want to start doing some training and education kinds of stuff.  I have done a lot of work with jQuery to customize some parts of our staff interface and we have other members that are experts in SQL and we have members that are better skilled at the Acquisitions module than others, so we're working on trying to put together online training where we can have like an hour long session where I can walk people through the steps of how to use jQuery to customize how things look on the screen in the staff client, for example.

And as far as Acquisitions go, we recently had a group
