Initial question was:

"Is it just me, or does anyone else have a problem with a certain patron from Bonner Springs who always seems to request our new books almost before they are processed?"


Next comment was:

"But we all agreed at one point that you don't have to fill all holds on your newest items." - I'm assuming this refers to section 2 of the Next agreement.
