Hello library directors,

For the 2019 Next Search Catalog users group meetings we are conducting a survey to determine which dates are best.  In the past these meetings have almost always been on Thursdays but we have had feedback from some libraries that they can never attend meetings on Thursdays.  So in 2019 we will be offering a variety of dates, a variety of days of the week, and a variety of locations.

Basehor Community Library, Morrill Public Library, and Osage City Library have offered to host and the February meeting will be at the NEKLS office on the same day as the drop-in date for help with the state's public library statistical survey - just like last year.

Please take some time to fill out the linked survey and select the dates that will work the best for your library to attend.

Thanks,

George
