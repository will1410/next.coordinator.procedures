NAME,

The password for the account I just sent you is:



That's XX words, one space between each word, the first letter of the sentence (and only the first letter) is capitalized, and the sentence ends with an exclamation mark.

Be sure to copy and paste or write this password down as soon as possible because this link can be opened once - and only once.  After it's been opened, future attempts to access this link will get a "Paste does not exist, has expired or has been deleted." message.  Also, this link will expire in one week.  If you do not open the link within 7 days, you will get the same message as if you tried to open the link a second time.

NAME,

I sent a username to you a few minutes ago via our Zendesk software.  This link will take you to the password that goes with that username.
