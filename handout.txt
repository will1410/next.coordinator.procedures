1. Confidentiality and privacy concern is staff at other libraries
2. In the European Union GDPR is the new rule - Koha is being adapted in order to meet the requirements of GRPR
3. Some of the features that will be coming include:

a. Default privacy rule will become "Never" for new patrons by the end of 2019 - opt in instead of opt-out
b. Staff will have the ability to edit a patron's privacy settings from the staff client - we'll have this before we have #a
c. Holds history will have similar privacy controls to checkout history - possibly by the end of this year
d. Patrons will have the ability to download all of their data from the OPAC with 1 click - probaly by the end of 2019
e. There will be a 1-click method available for staff that will both anonymize and delete any patron data on a "clear" patron's account - probably by the end of 2019
f. We will have the option of allowing "clear" patrons to self-delete - probably by the end of 2020
g. More non-identifiable information will be moved to the statistics table so that we can collect statistical data even if patron information is deleted/anonymized 

4. In addition to the Privacy and Confidentiality statement we're going to create an online course to help teach library staff about privacy and Confidentiality
